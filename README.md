# The-Coding-Genealogists-Portfolio

## Description

This is the portfolio for "The Coding Genealogist" a.k.a. Brandon L. Baird, M.Ed., AGÂ®. I have created this portfolio to display the different projects that I have created and worked on. Items will continue to be added to this portfolio as I work on more projects. This will be able to be sent to potential employers as proof of what I have accomplished with my coding. 

In this portfolio I used a lot of flexboxes and worked hard to make the site responsive. I learned a lot about the functionality of flexboxes and the importance of using responsive measurements instead of precise measurements.
